1. Variables → Prevent Reassignment
Makes the variable immutable (can’t reassign)
use of final is for variables, to make sure their value is assigned only once and cannot be changed after that.

Java:
final int MAX_AGE = 100;  // Can't change after assignment
MAX_AGE = 101;  // ❌ Error

Dart:
final maxAge = 100;
maxAge = 101;  // ❌ Error

Kotlin:
val maxAge = 100  // Immutable (like 'final')
maxAge = 101  // ❌ Error
Note: In Kotlin, there is no final keyword directly, but we can use val to achieve immutability.
