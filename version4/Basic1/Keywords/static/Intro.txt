Why does the concept exist?
1. Static is used to define variables, methods, and classes that belong to the class itself, rather than instances of the class.
2. It helps in:
    1. Sharing data across all instances of a class.
    2. Accessing members directly using the class name without creating objects.
    3. Implementing utility methods and constants.
