Types of Type Checking:
1. Static Type Checking:
Types are checked at compile time.
Errors are caught before the code runs.
Example languages: Java, Kotlin, Dart (by default)

2. Dynamic Type Checking:

Types are checked at runtime.
Errors appear only when the code runs.
Example languages: Python, JavaScript, Dart (with dynamic).


3. Implicit vs Explicit Typing:

Implicit Typing: The language infers the type automatically.
Example: Kotlin (with val), Dart (with var)
Explicit Typing: You must declare the type explicitly.
Example: Java, Dart (with int, String)
