dynamic

1. In Dart, dynamic is a type that disables type checking at compile time. 
2. When you declare a variable as dynamic, the type of that variable is determined only at runtime.


Declaration and Usage:
void main() {
  dynamic value = 42;  // Initially an int
  print(value.runtimeType);  // int

  value = "Hello";  // Now it's a String
  print(value.runtimeType);  // String
}

When to Avoid dynamic:
1. Overusing dynamic makes code harder to maintain and debug.


dynamic vs var vs Object:
dynamic a = 10;  // Can become anything
a = "Now a String";  // ✅ No problem

var b = 10;  // Inferred as int
b = "String";  // ❌ Error: Can't change type once inferred

Object c = 10;  // Holds any type but can't access type-specific members without casting
