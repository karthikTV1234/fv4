How setState() works:
   setState() rebuilds the entire widget every time you call it.
   Problem: If your widget is big, everything rebuilds — even the parts that don’t need to change!


How ValueNotifier is different:
   ValueNotifier only updates the widgets that care about the value.
   only widgets using ValueListenableBuilder will rebuild, not the entire screen.
