When to use:
Small State Changes:
   1. A switch to toggle dark mode.
   2. Form validation (e.g., checking if an input is valid).

Isolated UI Updates:
   1. When you want only part of the UI to rebuild — not the entire screen.
   2. Example: Updating just a Text widget when a counter changes.

Temporary State:
   1. Perfect for temporary states that don’t need to be shared across multiple screens.


When NOT to use ValueNotifier
1. ❌ Don’t use it for complex apps or when the state needs to be shared across many widgets.
