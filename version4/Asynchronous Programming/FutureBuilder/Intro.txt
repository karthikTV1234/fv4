What is FutureBuilder?
Why to Use FutureBuilder?
1. We use the async to declare a function as an asynchronous function, and its return type is automatically converted to a Future of the return data type.

Why Future Builder
1. The FutureBuilder widget is designed to handle asynchronous operations and update the UI based on the state of a Future.

How FutureBuilder Works:
Takes a Future<T> (which represents an asynchronous operation).
Listens to the Future and waits for its result.
Rebuilds the UI based on the Future's state (loading, done, or error).
