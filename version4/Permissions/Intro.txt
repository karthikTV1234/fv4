Why Do We Need Permissions?
1. Modern mobile apps often require access to sensitive data or device features like location, camera, microphone, or storage. 
2. To protect user privacy, operating systems enforce a permission system, where apps must explicitly request access, and users must grant or deny it.


Types of Permissions
   1. Normal Permissions (Auto-granted on install)
       Internet access, network state, Bluetooth, etc.
   2. Dangerous Permissions (Require user consent at runtime)
       Camera, Location, Microphone, Contacts, etc.

Do i need to write separate code for permissions for android & ios?
  1. Flutter has plugins like permission_handler that handle permissions on both platforms with a single codebase.
  2. If you want to avoid third-party plugins, you’ll need to use Platform Channels to handle permissions separately for Android and iOS


Permission Handling Flow(Android):
1. Declare in Manifest:
   Add required permissions in AndroidManifest.xml.
2. Request at Runtime:
   For dangerous permissions (Android 6.0+), prompt the user at runtime.
3. Handle User Response:
   Implement logic for granted, denied, or permanently denied cases.
4. Provide Rationale (Optional):
   This step occurs only if the user denies the permission once but hasn’t selected "Don’t ask again."
   Explain why the permission is needed before requesting it again.
