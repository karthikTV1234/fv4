What is App Versioning?

Version Name (visible to users) — Example: 1.0.0
  Shows the app’s version to the users.
  Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
  Example:
    1.0.0 → First release.
    1.1.0 → Added new features.
    1.1.1 → Bug fixes.


Version Code (used internally) — Example: 1
  A single number that increases with every new release.
  Used by app stores to identify updates.
  Example:
    Version 1.0.0+1 → First release.
    Version 1.1.0+2 → Second release.


1.0.0 → Version Name (User-visible)
+1 → Version Code (Internal)
