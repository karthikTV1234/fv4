Scenario:
Move from Entries List screen to Add Entry Screen.
After adding new entry, will come back to entries screen and list should be refresh.

Solution:
Manually trigger refresh with Navigator pop callback:
Example:
 onPressed: () async {
 // Navigate to AddEntry and refresh on return
 final result = await Navigator.pushNamed(context, AppRoutes.addEntry);
 if (result == true) {
   entriesBloc.add(LoadEntries());
 }
}
âœ… Pros:
  1. Keeps EntriesScreen as a StatelessWidget.
  2. Simpler, no need for lifecycle methods like initState().

In Add Entry Screen:
1. Just make sure that when you navigate back after adding a new entry, you pass true as the result.
Example:
Navigator.pop(context, true);
