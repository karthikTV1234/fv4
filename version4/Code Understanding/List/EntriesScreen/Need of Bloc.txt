using BLoC when fetching items from sqflite is a very good idea

✅ When fetching items from sqflite, BLoC typically does:
Event: LoadEntries → Triggers fetching data from the database.
State:
  EntriesLoading → Shows a loading indicator.
  EntriesLoaded → Shows the list of items.
  EntriesError → Shows an error message if something goes wrong.
